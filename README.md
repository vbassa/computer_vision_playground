# computer_vision_playground

Welcome! 
This repo is intended as a place to gather some small computer vision projects in notebooks, that don't justify having their own repo.

Each notebook is intended to have a self-explanatory title, and work standalone or aided by the utils.py file. 
They should be run in a virtualenv as follows:

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages -p /usr/bin/python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip3 install requirements.txt
jupyter-notebook
```

Questions or suggestions? Please feel free to add them as issues or reach out to vsbassagoda@gmail.com
